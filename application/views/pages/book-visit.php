<h2>Book a Class Visit to the Bruce Peel Special Collections Library</h2>
<div class="page">
	<p>There are several options for your class visit to the Bruce Peel Special Collections Library:</p>
	<h3>Librarian-led Class <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kTdk-dBOVpQAUfaT-zaZBdYkJKDpJRmAr1zKHr1FMQU/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=mail_form_link" class="myButton" id="book">Book It</a></h3> 
	<p>Librarians teach visiting classes in a wide range of subject areas.  For each class, a librarian will select relevant 
		library materials based on the course syllabus and the professor’s stated goals for the visit, offering 
		detailed commentary on selected rare materials, in addition to explaining proper handling procedures for rare materials and 
		relevant research methods for Peel collections.</p>
    <h3>Professor-led Class <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kTdk-dBOVpQAUfaT-zaZBdYkJKDpJRmAr1zKHr1FMQU/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=mail_form_link" class="myButton" id="book">Book It</a></h3>  
    <p>A professor can teach her own visiting class after a Librarian first offers the class instruction 
    	in proper handling procedures for rare materials and in research methods for Peel collections.  
    	The Librarian will be nearby throughout the class to provide ongoing advice about handling (as needed) and   
    	to enforce the library’s security protocols.  The professor is expected to provide library staff with a complete   
    	list of library materials requested (including author, title, and call number) at least one week before the class,   
    	and the materials will then be available for the professor to examine in the Peel Library’s Reading Room   
    	during normal hours (Monday-Friday 12:00-4:30pm) during the two days immediately prior to the class visit.  
    	Remember to book early!</p>
    <h3>Morning Exhibition Visit <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kTdk-dBOVpQAUfaT-zaZBdYkJKDpJRmAr1zKHr1FMQU/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=mail_form_link" class="myButton" id="book">Book It</a></h3> 
    <p>The Peel Library stages a wide variety of curated in-house exhibitions which are free to  
     visitors for quiet viewing – without prior arrangements – during normal hours (Monday-Friday 12:00-4:30pm). 
      It is possible to book a class visit to discuss an exhibition in the mornings only.  We cannot book  
       these visits in the afternoons when the Gregory Javitch Reading Room is open for quiet research.</p> 
    <h3>Peel Reading List</h3>  
    <p>When it is more important for students to handle/examine items than it is for them to 
      visit the Peel Library as a group, we recommend working with us to create a Peel Reading List for your  
       students.  A list of 5-15 items, with up to a paragraph of commentary on each item, would create a kind of  
        self-guided tour for your students.  Peel staff will verify call numbers and add handling and location notes.  In our experience, students are more  
          likely to follow through if the Peel Reading List is clearly connected with a particular assignment, but this is   not required. 
           The list (with complete bibliographical information and call numbers) should be submitted at least two weeks prior to the date it should be posted.</p>
